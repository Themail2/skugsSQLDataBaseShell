You will have to configure the SQL cursor to work with your database, my database is not the same as yours
You can find the instaciation of the SQL curson on line 66 in AddDatabaseEntrySrcript.py

Youll probably only need to change the password and database name, please check all of the cursor.execute() lines to make sure they match your database arguments.
